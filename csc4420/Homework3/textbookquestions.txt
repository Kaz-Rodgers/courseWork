Problem 2.29
The producer-consumer problem can be extended to a system with multiple producers
and consumers that write (or read) to (from) one shared buffer. Assume that each producer and consumer runs in its own thread. Will the solution presented in Fig. 2-28,
using semaphores, work for this system?

Yes the solution can be extended so long as the semaphores ensure that only one process can access
the shared buffer at one time.

Problem 2.30
Consider the following solution to the mutual-exclusion problem involving two processes P0 and P1. Assume that the variable turn is initialized to 0. Process P0â€™s code is
presented below:
/* Other code */
while (turn != 0) { } /* Do nothing and wait. */
Critical Section /* . . . */
turn = 0;
/* Other code */

For process P1, replace 0 by 1 in above code. Determine if the solution meets all the
required conditions for a correct mutual-exclusion solution.

No, because if you change 0 to 1 then P0 is blocked out of the critical section, this however does not put P1 inside of the critical section. Meaning that P0 is blocked without a purpose so this isn't a solution

Problem 2.31
How could an operating system that can disable interrupts implement semaphores?

If the command disable is given then the interrupts  are stopped. Say the semaphore has a value, if value = 0 and it's waiting add it to blocked queue.
If value is 0 and it's a signal instead then we would need the check the blocked processes queue
Lastly if value > 0 then it's a wait operation so decrease the semaphore by 1.
Once everything is done re-enable the interrupts.

Problem 3.7
Using the page table of Fig. 3-9, give the physical address corresponding to each of the
following virtual addresses:
(a) 20
(b) 4100
(c) 8300

A) 20 would be in virtual page 0 which maps to frame 2 which ranges from 8k - 12k so the offset for address 20 is 20 therefore it's page address is 8212.
B) 4100 would be in virtual page 1 which maps to frame 1 which ranges from 4k - 8k so the offset is 4 and the page address is 4100
C) 8300 would be in virtual page 2 which maps to frame 6 which ranges from 24k - 28k so the offset is 108 and the page address is 24684

Problem 3.13
If an instruction takes 1 ns and a page fault takes an additional n ns, give a formula
for the effective instruction time if page faults occur every k instructions.

My formula is the following:
G = k+n
Result = G/k


Problem 3.16
You are given the following data about a virtual memory system:
(a)The TLB can hold 1024 entries and can be accessed in 1 clock cycle (1 nsec).
(b) A page table entry can be found in 100 clock cycles or 100 nsec.
(c) The average page replacement time is 6 msec.

If page references are handled by the TLB 99% of the time, and only 0.01% lead to a
page fault, what is the effective address-translation time?

The address-translation time is the following:
601.98ns

Problem 3.29
Consider the page sequence of Fig. 3-15(b). Suppose that the R bits for the pages B
through A are 11011011, respectively. Which page will second chance remove?

D
