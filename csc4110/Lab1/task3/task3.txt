In task 3 the first error I received was about build tools to remedy that, I opened solution explorer right clicked the sln file. Clicked retarget solution, clean solution, and rebuild solution.

Next, I received an uninstalled external error. This meant that something was wrong with a library or header or implementation file, but there was only one error so one file was the source of my problem. 

Upon closer inspection the name appeared to contain something about DlgOptionsLooks.

Upon inspecting the class file I noticed that DoDataExchange method had a green line under it meaning that it was undefined.

Looking at the implementation file I removed the comments around that function.

After rebuilding code compiled successfully and application opened.
