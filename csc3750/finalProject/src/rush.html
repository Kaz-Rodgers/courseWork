            <h4>The process</h4>
            <p>During rush there is no obligation, fee, or any concrete requirement from us.</p>
            <p>Over the course of the first month of the semester we the Fraternity will host a large number of events where we invite everyone to get to know us.</p>
            <p>As the month winds down we hand out bids to formally invite people that we believe will be a good fit for the chapter to attend a formal event.</p>

            <h4>Criteria for bidding</h4>
            <p>In order to receive a bid you must fit the following criteria:</p>
