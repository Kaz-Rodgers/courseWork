                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Theta Tau is the nation’s largest professional engineering fraternity. Since its foundation at the University of Minnesota in 1904, over 35,000 engineers have joined its ranks.</p>
                <p>Epsilon Beta chapter was installed on May 19, 1951 at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan.</p>
                <p>The chapter has over 500 members and currently retains a roster of 15-30 active members.</p>
                <p>Epsilon Beta upholds the national purpose to develop and maintain a high standard of professional interest among its members and to unite them in a strong bond of fraternal fellowship. The fraternity sponsors a multitude of professional development events, social and brotherhood activities, and philanthropic fundraisers.</p>

                <h3>Professional Development</h3>
                <p>The chapter sponsors interview and resume workshops every semester at the College of Engineering. These workshops prepare members and other participating engineers for the professional job application process. The workshops are led by active members who hold co-op or internship positions with employers including but not limited to DTE, Ford, American Axle, Toyota, Maxion-Fumagalli, Marathon, Formtech, Faurecia, and the Wayne State College of Engineering. Once a year the chapter also hosts the “How to Succeed in Engineering” seminar, where successful alumni educate young engineers on the tricks of the trade.</p>

                <h3>Social</h3>
                <p>We host a wide variety of social events, from meet &nbsp; to bowling and everthing in between. Socializing is an important soft-skill to any engineer and we encourage getting out of the comfort zone</p>

                <h3>Brotherhood</h3>
                <p> We promote several bonding activities from our annual chapter retreat to weekly events from study nights to movie outings. Every week we make an effort to get together and actively do things.</p>

                <h3>Philanthropy</h3>
                <p>We support fundraising for the Sean Kimmerling Foundation for Testicular Cancer. Members also participate in community service events within the community, including planting trees for the city of Detroit, collecting recyclables at the yearly Dally in the Alley festival, community improvement projects with Blightbusters, donations to Red Cross and support for Habitat for Humanity.</p>
