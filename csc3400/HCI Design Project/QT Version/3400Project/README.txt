CSC3400Project
-GlWindow is the space where the image should
be rendered.
-MainWindow contains all the GUI stuff

Loader
-This is the unmodified object loader I mentioned the other
day. There would need to be some formatting changes if
we wanted to use it or something similar.

MyOpenGL
-This is a simplified version of our program that I'm using to
test functionality. It models a pyramid and can rotate it so far.
I'm still trying to get translation to work. The logic in these
functions, once they're done, can be applied to the light source.
